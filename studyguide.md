- Classes and objects

  - instantiation and **init**
  - instance variables, class variables, scope
  - instance methods vs class methods vs static methods
  - attributes and state
  - calling and accessing instance, class, and static attributes: `self`, `cls`, `obj.__class__`
  - creating and using properties, getters, and setters
  - access control in pythom: single and double underscore name conventions
  - encapsulation and polymorphism

- Inheritance

  - understanding `self` and `cls` with inheritance
  - the `super()` function
  - mix-ins (interface inheritance)
  - "is-a" vs. "has-a"
  - the influence of inheritance on scope
  - method resolution order(MRO)

- The `is` operatior and `id()` function
- Magic methods and attributes:

  - custom comparison methods: `__eq__`, `__ne__`,
    `__lt__`, etc
  - custom arithmetic methods: `__add__`, `__sub__`,
    `__mul__`, etc
  - custom formatting methods: `__str__` and `__repr__`
  - attributes: `__class__` and `__name__`

- Exceptikons:

  - what are exceptions
  - catching exceptions with `try/except`
  - raising exceptions
  - the exception hierarchy (general; you don't need to memorize the hierarchy)
  - custom exception classes

- working with collaborator objects
- reading OO code
- creating a code spike
